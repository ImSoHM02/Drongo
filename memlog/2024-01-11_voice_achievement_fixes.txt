Voice Achievement Duration Fix

Changes made to fix the voice achievement being awarded too early:

1. Timestamp Precision
- Modified timestamp storage to include microseconds using strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f', 'now')
- Changed voice_sessions table to use TEXT type to preserve timestamp precision
- Improved timezone handling to ensure consistent UTC timestamps

2. Session Persistence
- Added logic to preserve voice sessions during brief disconnects
- Only create new sessions if user doesn't already have an active one
- Only clear sessions when user fully disconnects from voice (not when switching channels)

3. Debug Logging
- Added detailed timestamp logging showing join and current times
- Added session duration logging showing seconds elapsed
- Added state change logging for session preservation and cleanup

These changes ensure that:
- Voice session durations are tracked accurately
- Brief disconnects don't reset session timers
- The Marathon Speaker achievement is only awarded after the full 2 hours (7200 seconds)
- Debug logs provide visibility into session tracking
