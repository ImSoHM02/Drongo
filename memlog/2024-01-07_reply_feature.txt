Feature: Reply Message Support

Added support for processing reply messages in the AI handler. When a user replies to a message with "oi drongo", the bot will now include the content of the message being replied to in its context.

Changes:
- Modified process_message() in ai.py to check for reply messages using message.reference
- Updated message fetching to use channel.fetch_message with the reference message ID
- Added error handling for failed reference fetches
- Integrated referenced content into the AI prompt structure

Technical Details:
- Uses message.reference to detect reply messages
- Fetches original message using message.channel.fetch_message(message.reference.message_id)
- Prefixes original message content with "Message being replied to: " for context
- Always includes full message content (including referenced message) in Claude's input

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed issue where bot would start typing but not send a message when replying
- Modified handle_oi_drongo to always include the full message content in Claude's input
- Ensures referenced message content is included even when user only says "oi drongo"

Example Usage:
User A: "What's the capital of France?"
User B: "oi drongo answer this" (replying to User A's message)
-> Bot will process both the question and the command together
