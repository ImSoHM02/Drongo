Change: Prevent bots from earning achievement points

Modified modules/achievements/achievements.py to add a bot check in the award_achievement method.
- Added user fetch at the start of award_achievement
- Added check for user.bot property to prevent bots from earning achievements
- Returns False early if the user is a bot

This change ensures that bot accounts cannot earn achievements, maintaining the integrity of the achievement system for human users only.
