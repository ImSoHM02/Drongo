Change: Remove FLUX_COMMAND and LOST_EVEN_ODD achievements

Modified modules/achievements/achievements.py to:
- Removed FLUX_COMMAND and LOST_EVEN_ODD from achievements dictionary
- Removed corresponding achievement checks from check_achievement method

This change removes these achievements from the system entirely. Note that any users who previously earned these achievements will still have them in their history unless manually cleared.
