[2024-12-22 13:59:41] Fixed version_tracker.py initialization error

Issue:
- AttributeError in version_tracker.py: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'anthropic_client'
- Root cause: version_tracker extension was being loaded before AI handler initialization

Fix:
- Moved version_tracker extension loading after AI handler initialization in drongo.py
- This ensures the AI handler is properly initialized before version_tracker attempts to use it

Changes made:
1. Reordered extension loading in setup_bot():
   - Removed version_tracker loading from early initialization
   - Added version_tracker loading after AI handler initialization

Impact:
- Version tracker can now properly generate and announce version changes using the AI handler
- Current version 0.1.2.7 will be announced (update from 0.1.2.6)

Additional Analysis:
- Verified that the AI code refactoring into modules/ai/anthropic does not affect version_tracker functionality
- AIHandler is properly exported through modules/ai/__init__.py
- anthropic_client is still initialized correctly in AIHandler class
- version_tracker's access to bot.ai_handler.anthropic_client remains unchanged
