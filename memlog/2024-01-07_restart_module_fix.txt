[2024-01-07] Restart Module Fix

Issue:
- TypeError during bot startup: "object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression"
- Error occurred in drongo.py during extension loading
- Root cause: restart.py module's setup function was not properly implemented as a coroutine

Changes Made:
1. Modified restart.py setup function to be async:
   - Changed `def setup(bot)` to `async def setup(bot)`
   - Added `return True` to ensure proper coroutine return value

Impact:
- Fixes bot startup error by properly implementing the extension loading protocol
- Ensures restart command functionality remains intact
- Maintains compatibility with discord.py extension loading system

Technical Details:
- Discord.py expects extension setup functions to be coroutines (async functions)
- Setup functions should return an awaitable value
- The fix ensures proper async/await chain during bot initialization
