Achievement System Enhancements - January 18, 2025

Made achievements less predictable and more engaging by implementing several key improvements:

1. First Discoverer System:
- Added first discoverer bonus points for being the first to discover an achievement
- Added first discoverer status tracking in database
- Enhanced achievement notifications to show first discoverer bonuses with ðŸ¥‡ medal
- First discoverers get extra points configured per achievement

2. Hidden Achievements:
- Added support for achievements that don't appear in lists until earned
- Hidden achievements don't count towards total achievement count
- Added optional hints for hidden achievements
- Achievement descriptions are only revealed after earning

3. Variable Requirements:
- Added daily changing achievement requirements
- Requirements randomize within configured ranges at midnight UTC
- Added achievement_variables table to track current requirements
- Supports various types of variable requirements:
  * Message count ranges
  * Time window variations (including ranges that cross midnight)
  * Number-based achievements
  * Pattern detection
- Special handling for time-based achievements that cross midnight:
  * Intelligently splits ranges like 22:00-04:00 into evening/morning segments
  * Randomly selects either evening or morning time slot each day
  * Prevents invalid time ranges while maintaining unpredictability

4. Enhanced Display:
- Updated achievement notifications to show:
  * Achievement description after earning
  * First discoverer bonus if applicable
  * Accurate progress excluding unearned hidden achievements
  * Total points including any bonuses
  * Current rank on leaderboard

5. Database Improvements:
- Added is_first_discoverer column to user_achievements
- Added achievement_variables table for dynamic requirements
- Added message_combos table for tracking patterns

These changes make the achievement system more engaging by:
- Rewarding early discovery
- Creating mystery around hidden achievements
- Varying requirements daily
- Providing clearer feedback and recognition
- Making achievements less predictable
- Handling complex time-based requirements properly

The system now encourages exploration and creates excitement around being the first to discover new achievements, while ensuring all mechanics work reliably even with complex requirements like cross-midnight time ranges.
