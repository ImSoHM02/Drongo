Task: Made Web Interface Accessible and Added Command

Changes Made:
1. Modified web server configuration
   - Updated server.py to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of just localhost
   - Allows access to web interface from outside the local machine

2. Added webstats command
   - Created new module: modules/web_link.py
   - Command gets machine's IP address using hostname -I on Linux
   - Shows public URL for the web statistics interface
   - Command visible to all users in the channel

3. Command Integration
   - Added command to register_commands.py
   - Added module initialization in drongo.py
   - Includes command execution tracking

Access:
- Web interface accessible at http://<server-ip>:5000
- Use /webstats command in Discord to get the current URL

Note: The web interface reads from the existing chat_history.db database and displays statistics about message counts, unique users, and top users.
