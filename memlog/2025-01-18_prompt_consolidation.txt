Changes made:
1. Created new prompts.py file to consolidate all AI prompts in one location
2. Moved all prompts from ai_prompt.py to prompts.py:
   - SYSTEM_PROMPT (renamed from DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT)
   - get_insult_prompt()
   - get_compliment_prompt()
   - get_mode_change_prompt()
3. Updated ai.py to import from prompts.py instead of ai_prompt.py
4. Updated all references to DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT to use SYSTEM_PROMPT
5. Removed ai_prompt.py as it's no longer needed

Reason for changes:
- Better organization of code by having all prompts in a dedicated file
- More maintainable as all prompt-related changes can be made in one place
- Clearer separation of concerns between prompt definitions and AI logic
