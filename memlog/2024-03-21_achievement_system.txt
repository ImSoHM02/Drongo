# Achievement System Implementation - 2024-03-21

## Changes Made
- Created new module `modules/achievements/` for achievement system
- Implemented SQLite database storage for achievements in `achievements.db`
- Integrated with existing AI system to use Jaxon's eshay character for achievement announcements
- Added Achievement class to store achievement metadata (name, description)
- Added "Test Achievement" with proper name and description
- Enhanced AI responses to include achievement name and reason for earning it
- Added Discord markdown formatting for achievement announcements (indented block style with trophy emoji)
- Updated to use claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 AI model

## Achievement Details

1. Test Achievement:
   - Name: "Test Achievement"
   - ID: FIRST_REQUEST
   - Description: "Earned by asking for an achievement using the 'iwantanachievement' command"
   - Trigger: User types "iwantanachievement" in any channel

2. Chatterbox Achievement:
   - Name: "Chatterbox"
   - ID: CHATTY
   - Description: "Sent 50 messages in a single day"
   - Trigger: Automatically checks message count in chat_history.db for the last 24 hours
   - Implementation: Uses SQL query with datetime functions to count messages within a rolling 24-hour window

## Technical Details
- Database Schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE user_achievements (
      user_id INTEGER,
      achievement_id TEXT,
      earned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      PRIMARY KEY (user_id, achievement_id)
  )
  ```
- Uses bot's AIHandler for consistent eshay-style responses
- Prevents duplicate achievements through SQLite's PRIMARY KEY constraint

## Files Modified
- Created: modules/achievements/achievements.py
- Created: modules/achievements/__init__.py
- Modified: drongo.py (added achievement system integration)

## Multi-Server Support Fix
- Moved AI response processing outside primary guild check
- Moved achievement checking outside primary guild check
- Now only database storage and stats tracking are limited to primary guild
- Bot features (AI, achievements) now work in all servers
