Issue: AttributeError in on_interaction handler
Description: The bot was attempting to call super().on_interaction() which doesn't exist in the parent class (commands.Bot).

Changes made:
1. Removed invalid super().on_interaction() call
2. Added proper error handling around interaction processing
3. Implemented process_application_commands() for proper interaction handling
4. Added error logging for interaction processing failures

Impact: This fix ensures slash commands are properly processed while maintaining command usage tracking functionality.

Testing:
- Verified slash commands are tracked in the database
- Ensured proper error handling for failed interactions
- Maintained existing command tracking functionality
